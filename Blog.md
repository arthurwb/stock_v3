*The Brain*
Build a brand, something that can be remebered, but not something vapid. Make something that means something to someone other than yourself. You are dust, what is left when you are gone? There are so many different paths to take yet you spend your years decomposing into nothingness. Yes you step outside, you feel the sun on your skin, you work and you provide your grease to the machine, but you do not really leave your bed. The market exists as a means to an end, a way to express yourself in the most raw and carnal of ways. The market is a chance for you to become the person that you had always wanted to be, a chance to do things that god himself deemed uncouth. You step beyond the threshold, and find that there is not really all that much to do here...
